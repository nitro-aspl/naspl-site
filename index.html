        <p class="white-background">
          “The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity.” - Amelia Earhart </br></br>
          Armed with a vision and driven with a passion for taking up challenges, our founders dreamt and dreamt BIG to
          manufacture import-dependent chemicals in our country. Our shared values of Integrity, Responsibility and
          Quality gives us the energy and encouragement to persevere towards this goal.
          Thus in 2018, Nitroalkanes specialist private limited (NASPL) was established to strengthen our country’s
          self-reliability in fine chemicals, speciality chemicals, intermediates and pharmaceutical active ingredients.
          We embarked on building NASPL from scratch in a “red” category industrial park at Attivaram, Naydupeta,
          Tirupati district, Andra Pradesh, India. It is situated about 100 Km from Chennai and is well-connected by
          land, sea and air.
          We began our operations in 2021 where we successfully commercialized DL-2-Amino Butanol (DL2-AB), a
          key-starting material for Ethambutol Hydrochloride, a life-saving drug and first-line of treatment for
          Anti-Tuberculosis. Having witnessed first-hand the challenges faced by many due to the global monopoly of this
          key-starting material, our commercialization of this intermediate was a major breakthrough for the
          availability of this drug. India is completely import-dependent on this product (i.e. DL2-AB) and hence its
          commercialization in India is a step forward in the right direction for our world to become Tuberculosis-free.
