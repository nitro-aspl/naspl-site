        <h2 class="section-heading text-color-white">About Us</h2>
        <p class="white-background">
          Nitroalkanes Specialist Private Limited (NASPL), a small-scale industry was incorporated in 2018 with a goal
          to manufacture Import substitute pharmaceutical Key starting materials and intermediates. The factory is
          located at Attivaram industrial park, Naidupeta, Balaji district (newly formed Tirupati district), Andhra
          pradhesh. This location was chosen as it is a “red” category industrial park and just 2 hours drive from
          Chennai city and port. The company’s corporate office is at Porur in Chennai. Currently there are about 30
          full-time employees and 15 casual employees.
          <p /><br />
        <h5 class="white-background">FOUNDER’s VISION</h5>
        <p class="white-background">The Indian pharmaceuticals industry is heavily import-dependent on the key starting
          material (KSM) and key intermediates of majority of “Active pharmaceutical ingredients (API)” – over 70% of
          the KSM are imported in India.
          The founder Mr. Pakshirajan who has witnessed this challenge for over 3 decades took up the initiative to
          produce the very important lifesaving Tuberculosis drug intermediate namely DL-2 Amino butanol & D-2 Amino
          butanol, which India is completely import dependent due to the world monopoly of these products by M/s
          Advancion Sciences (formerly Angus Chemical Co.), a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Company, USA.
          This intermediate is used to manufacture the API – Ethambutol Hydrochloride. The market of this API is
          dominated by M/s Lupin who has 60% market share of the 900 MT/ annum market. Since both these multi-national
          companies – Lupin and Advancion have long-term relations to continue the monopoly in the market – both the
          prices and the supply has only impacted the patients worldwide.
          Therefore, NASPL worked hard to develop a very critical technology to manufacture this intermediate in India.
          This initiative has been welcomed by many large companies such as Macleods Pharma, Mumbai, Concept
          Pharmaceuticals, Mumbai and Cadila Pharmaceutical, Ahmedabad, Centurion Laboratories Pvt Ltd, Ankleshwar to
          name a few.
